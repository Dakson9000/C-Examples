# C Examples
 This github repo is collection of C examples that I have created during my learning process. I have created these examples to understand the concepts of C programming language. I hope these examples will help you to understand the concepts of C programming language.

## filesize.c
This example is used to find the size of a file in bytes. The file name is passed as a command line argument. The file size is calculated using three ways and the result is printed on the console.

## trees.c

This C code presents a straightforward implementation of a binary search tree, complete with functions for inserting, deleting, and searching for values within the tree. The primary function showcases how these operations work by carrying out basic tasks such as inserting new values, searching for specific ones, and removing existing values.

Key features of the code include:

Insertion: Values are added to the tree in a sorted manner, ensuring the tree's ordered structure is maintained.
Deletion: Values can be removed from the tree while preserving its organization and integrity.
Lookup: The code allows for searching the tree to find a particular value.
Tree Traversal: It enables the traversal of the tree to display its contents.

## server.c
This example is used to create a server using socket programming in C. The server listens on a port and accepts the client's connection. Once the client is connected, the client sends an operation to the server. The server performs the operation and sends the result back to the client.

## client.c
This example is used to create a client using socket programming in C. The client connects to the server using the server's IP address. Once the client is connected, the client sends an operation to the server. The server performs the operation and sends the result back to the client.
